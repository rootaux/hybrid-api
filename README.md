# Read Me for starting the API

The application is dockerized, so by running the following command, one can start the api services.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

The application is located at `http://localhost:3000` and API routes are same as mentioned in the docs.

For example to get the list of sellers one can visit `http://localhostL:3000/api/buyer/list-of-sellers` to get a list of sellers.
